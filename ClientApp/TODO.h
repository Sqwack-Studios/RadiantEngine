TODO[high prio]: Triangulo
TODO[high prio]: Abstract Quill so they don't expose STL types and pollute everything? Search alternatives otherwise? 
TODO[high prio]: Explore how to do Jumbo builds
TODO[high prio]: remove STL headers

TODO[mid prio]: Move shaders to a registry file that can be used for the runtime and the offline shader compilation step, so
it's not necessary to trigger shader compiler recompilation.
TODO[mid prio]: Shader compiler must accept a file input name, and an output name for the file given they can have multiple shader stages
in the same file. This is done to iterate over the same file and increase compilation speed.
